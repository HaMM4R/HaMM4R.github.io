									Electroknight is a fast-paced VR shooter developed by Venn Studios. The team comprises of myself and some friends.
									 All work in the engine is done by myself including programming, principle game design and setup, with my team mates
									  Chris handling art, and Mateusz creating the music and sounds. We are working on the game in our spare time alongside
									   our masters studies in the hopes of releasing within the next 14 months 
								</p>
								<p>
									Unlike other games, the world of Electroknight isn’t limited to one plane. We empower players to explore as they wish by 
									allowing them to attach to any surface, and certain ingame objects. There is something truly special about being in environments 
									that are so unlike our own, it’s quite something to look up, see these awe-inspiring structures and know you can go there. We’ve
									 been focusing on an octahedron shaped starting area in our current build, but imagine opening a trap door on a surface and falling 
									 into a completely different space while enemies pour through the roof and down the walls to engage in frenetic combat. Sounds exciting,
									  doesn’t it?     
								</p>
								<p>
									We’ve developed a robust AI system to create interesting gameplay encounters and twists on common game mechanics such as health to create 
									a truly unique experience and want to push players to be mobile and aggressive. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The game is being developed for Oculus Quest and PCVR using the Unity engine. Building for the Quest presents a unique set of challenges. 
									Its very rare these days that developers have to take tight memory and graphics processing power into account when building software but building 
									something for the most computationally heavy medium for a device that is in essence an old Android phone can be pretty daunting but extremely 
									fun to work on. Me and the Unity profiling tools have become the best of friends through this process and has taught me the importance of proper
									 optimization.

									Please feel free to check out the footage I’ve linked below but keep in mind, the game is still very early in development and nothing should be considered final!

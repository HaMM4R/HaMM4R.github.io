									RhythmTrain is an open-source sight-reading trainer app designed to help users learn and improve their classic
									 western music notation reading abilities. It is the platform I’m using to run my master’s experiment to observe
									  the effects of leaderboards on engagement on gamified platforms. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The project was started by me last year for my undergraduate studies and was originally programmed in Python using
									 the Kivy graphics library for mobile. The library was cumbersome and difficult to develop with but being python based,
									  afforded us the ability to run beat detection algorithms and had support for MP3 playback, something missing from other
									   open-source alternatives. The original idea was to have the game detect the beats in a users own music collection and
									    display random rhythms, but due to the inaccuracy of these techniques, we opted for a less dynamic approach. It was 
										still possible to add a user’s own songs to the game, but adding these required users to either map the beats to the 
										song, or choose songs that had a static tempo with the application then creating the beats. The original prototype can 
										be seen in the image below.

								<p>
									For my masters, it was decided to recreate the project in a more suitable environment. We opted for Godot as it had come a long way 
									since my initial analysis of platforms a year prior and now had mp3 support. I worked closely with an undergraduate student who began
									 work on building the software for his dissertation, while I designed the application, started researching and designed the experiment 
									 that would surround the app. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The undergraduate has since finished his dissertation and provided me a fantastic base to work on. I have since taken over primary development
									 with a focus on polish, game features, building the database and integrating the game with a REST api. We’ve opted to use Supabase to store our
									  data (an open-source firebase alternative) with the systems for this interaction being built by me. For a comprehensive list of the features 
									  I’ve worked on, please see the Gitlab below, the application is open-source so feel free to poke around in the code and maybe compile it for 
									  yourself!

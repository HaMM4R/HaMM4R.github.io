								</header>
								<p style="text-align: left">
									Hi! I’m Reece, I’m a masters by research student at the University of Lincoln looking at gamifying musical sight-reading practice. 
									Since tinkering with game engines all the way back in 2012, I’ve been hooked on building software. While other people 
									my age were busy playing games, I was trying my hand at making them. I worked on my first real game with a few others called
									 Covert Ops. In hindsight it’s obvious we were never going to finish it, the project was way out of scope, we were all very green and development
									  stopped in 2014. But after that experience I knew I wanted to be a games programmer. 
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: left">
									Now the history lesson is over, lets go into a bit of what I am doing now. Outside of building software, I spend my time playing drums in Lincoln’s worst
									 named band, <i>No Flamingos on a Sunday</i>. We’ll play anything from Motorhead to Britney Spears, with some originals thrown in for good measure, though
									  I like to think we sound better than the name does! I dabble in playing guitar and writing songs but drums is where I feel most at home, having played for
									   over ten years, but music isn’t the only art form that gets my attention. I’m very keen on film and probably know more about Star Wars than a fully grown
									    man should, but anything with good performances, direction and cinematography is bound to pique my interest. 
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
									More information my masters research can be found in the RhythmTrain project. I’ll be sad to finish University this year, I’ve had a fantastic time but I’m 
									super excited to move onto the next stage and hopefully find work in games!

										<h2 style="text-align: left">Qualifications and Experience</h2>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align: left">
										I’ve spent the last three years at the University of Lincoln studying Computer Science and undertaking some extra-curricular courses, and
										 before that at the College of West Anglia doing the same.  During my masters’ studies I’ve also taken on the role of associate demonstrator
										  to help out undergraduate students and have been producing bite sized tutorials for the schools YouTube channel. Feel free to check out my 
										  qualifications!									</p>
									<ul style="text-align: left">
										<li>BSc (Hons) Computer Science – 1st </li>
										<li>Computer Science Extended Diploma Grade – D*D*D* </li>
										<li>3 AS Levels A-D </li>
										<li>14 GCSE’s A-C (including Maths and English)</li>
									</ul>
									<p style="text-align: left">
										Outside of University, I’ve worked on various projects wearing many different hats including serving as a programmer and project manager
										 on the Halo fan game, Installation 01 (at various times between 2014-2019) and more recently working as a freelance programming on RC 
										 Airplane Challenge for Strange Games, creator of the well-received PSVR game, Honor and Duty: D-Day. You can find more information on these
										  projects below.

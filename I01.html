									<p style="text-align: center;">“Reece is the embodiment of dedication and passion. He is a team-player and is always putting in 110% of the effort each and every time. 
										My project would not have gotten off the ground like it did without the help of him” - Alexander Rogic (“TheChunkierBean”, founder and 
										project lead on Installation 01)

									Installation 01 is a Halo fan game developed by Soon Studios. I first joined the project back in 2014, putting
									 together a workable build of the game in five days for showcase at a Halo fan event, CE3. I worked on the project
									  as and when I could and built a close relationship with the development team. 								</p>
								<p>
									Between 2015 and 2017 I served as project manager and a gameplay programmer for the game, working with a team of around 
									20 individuals. During this time we received lots of media coverage including articles from game journalist websites such 
									as Kotaku and IGN but behind closed doors development was troubled by a constant changing of team members and software re-writes 
									as lead programmers came and went. Managing a fan game can be difficult, people don’t always have lots of time and life/work 
									commitments often meant team members would have to leave the project or would have little/varying time to contribute. In hindsight 
									I wish I had pushed harder to focus on getting a minimum viable product out of the door, rather than focusing on having something
									 feature complete and consumable on a mass scale given the uncertainty of the work environment, but the hype around the game created
									  by the media coverage had given us a false sense of confidence and we were quite inexperienced.								</p>

								<p> That’s not to say it was unproductive, during this two year period we put out lots of quality content (some of which I will link
									 at the end of this post), had a load of fun building and testing the game and from working with a group of far more experienced 
									 programmers, learned more about software that I could ever have hoped to on my own. As I mentioned, my focus was mainly on gameplay 
									 systems. I was responsible for features such as grenades, melee, the motion tracker and spent lots of time polishing and adding juiciness 
									 to the game as well as assigning tasks and priorities and trying to make sure work was completed in a reasonable timeframe. 
								</p>
								<p>
								I left the project in 2017 to focus on my studies but rejoined briefly in 2019 to retool another fan project (Sundog) with 
								Installation 01 assets and extra game features (such as the motion tracker and animation systems) in time for PAX 2019 while other developers 
								worked on the main build (which at the time was not functioning). This build of the game would go on to be demonstrated during the PAX weekend 
								of 2019 which was well received. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I still remain close with members of the development team, with many of them going on to work at AAA studios. I’m extremely proud of what 
									we achieved in those two years and despite being at times stressful and wishing I’d done some things differently, it was a pleasure to work on.
